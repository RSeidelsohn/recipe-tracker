They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words.</p>
            <p>We are going to make placeholder text great again. Greater than ever before. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision. I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice."

            <p>You’re disgusting. I write the best placeholder text, and I'm the biggest developer on the web by far... While that's mock-ups and this is politics, are they really so different? You know, it really doesn’t matter what you write as long as you’ve got a young, and beautiful, piece of text. An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud. The other thing with Lorem Ipsum is that you have to take out its family.</p>
            <p>My placeholder text, I think, is going to end up being very good with women. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! When other websites give you text, they’re not sending the best. They’re not sending you, they’re sending words that have lots of problems and they’re bringing those problems with us. They’re bringing mistakes. They’re bringing misspellings. They’re typists… And some, I assume, are good words.</p>
            <p>We are going to make placeholder text great again. Greater than ever before. Look at that text! Would anyone use that? Can you imagine that, the text of your next webpage?! Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision. I was going to say something extremely rough to Lorem Ipsum, to its family, and I said to myself, "I can't do it. I just can't do it. It's inappropriate. It's not nice." Lorem Ipsum's father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald's being, you know, shot.</p>
            <p>The other thing with Lorem Ipsum is that you have to take out its family. Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites.</p>
            <p>Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. You have so many different things placeholder text has to be able to do, and I don't believe Lorem Ipsum has the stamina. We have so many things that we have to do better... and certainly ipsum is one of them.</p>
